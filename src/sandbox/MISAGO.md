# Setup and Running Locally

Navigate into the src/sandbox/misago directory and run the following commands:

To start, clone the repository and run ./dev init command in your terminal. This will build necessary docker containers, install python dependencies and initialize the database. After command does its magic, you will be able to start development server using the docker compose up command.

After development server starts, visit the <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> in your browser to see your Misago installation.
