            "description": "Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.\n\nIn the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.\n\nThe game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.\n\n",

This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).\n\nThe primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.\n\nFor example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.\n\nSpace Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.\n\n",

The board shows a map of the world with many different branching paths, and players advance the expeditions by placing plastic arrows. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches one of your private site cards or one of the public site cards, you score that card. Certain spaces on the board allow you to play again immediately, and other spaces allow you to pick up a bonus action card that you can play at any time on one of your turns.\n\nThe game ends when someone has scored all of their cards, then whoever has the highest total score wins.

            "description": "History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.\n\nBefore the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.\n\nAt any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.\n\nThen scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.\n\nAfter all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).\n\nAfter the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.\n\n",

As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.\n\nThe game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.\n\nThe prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).\n\nVariations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.\n\n",

In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.\n\nPlayers are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.\n\nDuring the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.\n\nThe regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.\n\nAt the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.\n\n",

In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.\n\nThe deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.\n\nIf, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare \"Zero!\" and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.\n\nAfter a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!\n\n",

The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.\n\nEach player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.\n\nIt's a fun 20 minutes.

The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.\n\n",

There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.\n\nThe cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.\n\nWhen collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.\n\nThe basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.\n\n",

Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total. Very nice artwork and goofy band names (as only the Germans can do it) are complemented by one of the cooler game components ever; a wooden \"CD Player\" that the DJ (dealer) uses to tally up the votes.\n\nPlease be aware that, although this was formerly listed as a family game, a few of the band names contain adult language.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     BrettspielWelt (real-time)\n\n\n",

The Confederate player can build ironclads, naval mines (torpedoes), submarines, conduct overseas purchases, and work towards foreign intervention. The Union player can build up his naval blockade, his ironclad fleet, fight draft riots, secure the Border States, and issue the Emancipation Proclamation.

MacGowan\n\n\n(BGG description:)\n\nThis is the 4th entry in the We the People system of games, following Hannibal and Successors (but pre-dating Paths of Glory, which is arguably more of a spin-off than a follow-on). The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.\n\n\n(Note from Mark Herman:)\n\nThe game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that \"For The People\" is based on \"Hannibal v Rome\", but was my second game in the \"We The People\" genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook. This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download.\n\n",

The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.\n\nPlayers are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.\n\nOn their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:\n\na) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. \nb) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile\nc) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.\n\nOnce a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.\n\nThe winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.\n\n(precis from the review by gschloesser)\n\n",

The winner is the first player to complete a major, minor, and short treasure route.  Treasure Routes are diamonds, rubies, Inca Gold, Art Treasures, Mexican Silver, and money.  Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.  Smuggle Masters can team up against Treasure Czars for two teams of three players.  Three teams of two players include Border Jumpers, Port Runners, and Bootleggers.  Or it can be everybody for themselves. Everything is color coded for quick visual reference as to players and pieces.  Quick Start Rules supplement the Rules of Play to allow immediate play to begin.\n\n",

            "description": "Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line \"goal line stand\" to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for \"long gains\", the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.\n\nEach play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.\n\nFor variety, three types of offense (\"pro style\", \"aerial game\" and \"ball control\") are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.\n\nSimple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the \"More Information\" screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.\n\nFor those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.\n\n",

The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.\n\nA separate \"ballast sheet,\" or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew. Five different Zeppelin models are provided, from the Type M converted passenger liner to the mammoth Type X \"war Zeppelin.\"\n\nThe game's components are a step above desktop publishing quality; cards and counters must be cut apart before play. The game provides ten scenarios, plus a campaign game and variant rules for two players. An expansion set,  featuring Riesenflugzeugabteilungen oversized bomber planes in place of Zeppelins, is also available.

Walls can be placed between any two adjacent castles forming a border.\n\nThe two pieces begin on their respective starting squares, which are located diagonally across the board from each other. Each piece begins surrounded by 4 walls. The object is to move one of the walls on each turn in order to either move your piece to your opponent's starting square or to enclose your opponent's piece so that it can no longer move.\n\n",

            "description": "Sulkydrom is Trap racing round a circuit, basically modern 'chariot' racing, popular in continental Europe and the southern US, but unseen in Britain. The eight horses are named from Atletico to Happy Days and you play either Horse or Position cards to allow each to move, with the leading horse going first. The cards show the lengths they may move from 0 to 4 including half lengths, e.g. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 etc. Shifting lanes costs 1 length, but the Sulky only moves forward a half length. As with many such games, the inside lane has fewer spaces on the bend than the outside lanes. But if you are blocked in and cannot move, you miss your go completely. Taking the inside line therefore is quicker, but makes it easier for others to block you. Each player also has a Joker and Gallop card to help themselves and hinder others once in the game. The races are meant to be quick and the designer encourages betting on them, but doesn't give a method. A solid, colorful production with a jigsaw board, the game comes packaged in a large wooden box with sliding card lid.\n\n",

A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.\n\nA series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.\n\nThe game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.\n\nThis later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des SonnenkÃ¶nigs.\n\n",

Before each round, the players distribute 6 pawns on the course. One player then rolls all 6 dice and turns over the timer. Players now assign the dice to the pawns and try to determine the highest score possible. The player announcing the highest number before the timer runs out performs his move. \nEach pawn moves, in clockwise order, the number of spaces shown on it assigned die and scores 1 point for each pawn on the space it ends its move. If the player managed to meet or exceed his/her predicted number, the player receives a chip from every other player; if not, the player gives a chip to each player and sits out the next round.\nThe game ends after a player ends up without chips, with twice the original number of chips, or after a predefined number of turns or a set amount of time.\nCorona was published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.\nThe introductionary (and a few other) variation(s) from Corona were republished as 'Moonstar' in 1981 (by Avalon Hill).\nMoonstar was rethemed as 'Harun' in 1984 (by Edition Perlhuhn).\nIn 1993 Corona was republished and got a new variant included  as 'Orbit' (by Franckh-Kosmos).\n\n",

A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.

Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.\n\nThis is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra \"lives\" and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.

Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.\nStonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.\n\n",

The guns are deployed along the side of the board and are used to fire at and destroy enemy tanks.

The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can \"see\" all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!

Move your pawn on\nthe inner track in the direction of the arrows, as many spaces as you rolled.\n\n2nd action\nFollow the directions for the space you land on.\n\nMost of the spaces on the inner track are connected to outer fields. The outer field decides what options a player has in each case. So, you can - according to the outer field - buy or sell stock, save money or withdraw it, buy or sell real estate, buy or sell a life insurance policy, buy or sell a treasury note, or buy or sell precious\nmetals. Or you may land on a wage or salary space, which always brings profit.\n\nWhat you buy you can also sell, depending which space you are on. When you are on a stock space, for example, you can only buy or sell shares. When you are on one of the two savings spaces, you can only buy or sell savings cards, etc.\n\n3rd action\nYou must draw a Banking card and either play it now or keep it in your hand. You can also draw and play a precious metal card to replace the card already lying in the middle of the game board.\n\nPrecious metal cards are an optional draw. A Banking card must be drawn along with the precious metal card so the price of the precious metals and shares of stock change again and again.\n\n",

If you are Good, you must try to keep the baby, Elora Danan, out of the evil Bavmorda's clutches and take the child to safety.  If you are Evil, you must try to find the baby, capture her, and take her to Nockmaar Castle.  One of the Good characters starts with Elora Danan, but the Evil players do not know who.  Thus the Evil players move around the board, searching for the Good characters and fighting them in an attempt to capture the baby.\n\nThe Good characters begin weak, but become more powerful as the game progresses.  They move about the board, searching for Places of Power and gaining Treasures which make them more powerful or enable them to free people who will protect Elora Danan, which is one way for them to win the game.  The other is to become powerful enough to defeat Bavmorda in combat.\n\n",

Every player id dealt 10 commodity cards which change the price up or down of one or more of the commodities.  Every player starts with $10,000 and the winner is the player who has the most money after everyone has played all ten of their cards.\n\nOn a players turn they can: 1 - enter or close out a contract (going either long - betting the price will go up; or short - betting the price will go down; 2-  play a price movement card; 3 - roll the dice (usually either resulting in a commodity price movement or an action card draw (random event)).\n\nThe nature of the futures market is that you take positions based on whether you believe a commodity price will go up or down.  If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.\n\nThe game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).  There is still quite a bit of luck in the game,  with wild swings possible in some commodity prices, but you start with all the cards you will have and therefore have a good bit of information about some price swing possibilities - all you need is some help and a bit of help from the random events.\n\n",

It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.\n\nThe combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.\n\nWhen character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base. If Queen loses battle, the winning character is moved to center and control of the Queen is changed.\n\nThe game is based upon the the movie \"Star Wars Episode I\".\n\nThe game does probably only exist in Sweden, Norway and Finland.\n\"Kampen om Naboo\" = \"Fight for Naboo\".\n\n",

If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the \"correct\" side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.\n\nYou start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto \"?\" spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.\n\nTo survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.\n\nFrom the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:\n\nA political strategy game\n\"In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival. That means energy and the key to energy is oil. In this game there is but one object - and that is to survive\"\n\n",

If you think a seller is a black-hearted pirate, you can challenge the scoundrel.  If you're right you get the goods for free!  But, if you wrongfully accuse an honest merchant, you will pay dearly.  What's your selling style?\n\nThe object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.\n\nBig Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).\n\nIf you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.\n\nOf course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.\n\n",

            "description": "This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.\n\nThe central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.\n\nThere's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.\n\nThere are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).\n\nThe theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.\n\n",

Frenzied dashes down polished corridors with howling mobs of beasties in hot pursuit. A kicking and screaming Penny being carried off. Again. A desperate battle for time as the Professor prattles inanely, \"Maybe we can reason with them\".\n\nThe mutants come in three flavors: normal, radio-active and leader. Map and set-up are randomized for re-playability (there are movable Wall counters). The game is played in 10 turns; victory for either side hinges on control of the Tech Room (where a gate to an unpolluted Earth-like planet has been opened, hopefully allowing the \"normies\" to escape the muties). Optional rules allow for hidden movement.\n\nIncludes 5-page rulebook, 25\" x 12\" board, 133 counters, reference card.\n\nAlso the title of a simplified version having the same title. Yaquinto shipped this version free with any order. The mutants, invade the college represented by 25 rooms. If the mutants reach the control room in 10 turns they win. An 11\" x 17\" sheet of light cardboard includes map, rules and counters.\n\n",

Building additional tanks costs one grain, oil, and mineral unit plus $500 million to the bank. Players may build as many tanks as they can afford per year.\nTanks may be driven, airlifted, or sea convoyed at any territory the player owns. The tanks add a Fire Power Rating of 5 during battles.

You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a \"camp\" marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.\n\nGoldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.\n\n",

A mix of cards and dice and symbols.\n\nThe Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.\nThe space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.\n Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.\nThe player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.\n\n",

Approximately 1400 tanks and assault guns met head to head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate sucess or failure of Operation Zitadelle.\n\nThe 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions. During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and replused a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night, the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Gaurds Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage fighting at close ranges. In the end, the Russians were driven back from the town, but the Germans were unable to push them any further. Losses exceeded three hundred tanks on each side.\n\n\nThis wargame was first published as one of the Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was later released in a boxed version with the name on the cover shortened to Armor at Kursk.\n\nUnits are German Battalions and Russian Regiments & Brigades, though all are similar in size and manpower. Hexes are 400 meters across, turns represent one hour.\n\n",

Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.\n\nThe Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.\n\nSETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.\n\nMOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.\n\nCAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another. A player can never make more than one capture in his turn.\n\n",

Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.\n\nThe map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.\n\nThe game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.\n\nAngola contains:\n    2 decks of cards (110 total)\n    32 page full-color rulebook\n    2 player aid cards\n    22\" by 34\" inch map \n    3 countersheets \n    4 six-sided dice\n\nDeveloper: Adam Starkweather\n\n",

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.\nAnother important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.\n\nAdditional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War: Battle for Germany; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?\n\n",

For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.\n\nQuest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.\n\nTwo different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively \"winning\" the game). The #140 card was available in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs. There are also extra rules to cater for using shields in the UK version.\n\nBuy Microbadge\n\n\n",

Players also, with the appropriate cards, attack opponents, the loser forfeiting one (in a battle) or two (in a war) Master cards. Attacks and defenses can be enhanced with cards representing such things as weapons and ki. Shorter variants can be played.\n\n",

Your Task Forces consits of surface ships, submarines, patrol aircraft and tactical fast jet aircraft, represented by data cards, and task force counters on the map. You utilize radar, sonar and visual search to detect your enemy task forces. You utilize naval gunfire, surface-to-surface missiles, and air-to-surface missiles to defeat them, using die-rolls and data cards. The game is easy to learn. It is a wargame, but the heavily themed weapon aspects are abstracted to a very basic level, without loosing it's high technology appeal. After 30 minutes study of the rules you should be able to set up the first scenario, where you have one task force each, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer against a Sovremennyy class destroyer.

Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair & Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.\n\nAll of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.\n\nIn addition, Corsairs & Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war. Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of your Corsair or Hellcat? Pilots, man your planes...\n\nNOTE: In order to play Corsairs & Hellcats you must have a copy of Zero!.\n Components Included:\n\n    16-Page Rules Booklet\n    88 full-color, die-cut counters\n    124 full-color Playing Cards (2 60-card decks and 4 Full Throttle Cards)\n    1 double-sided 11\" x 17\" Resource Sheet/Player Aid Card\n    2 double-sided Campaign Log Sheets (5 of each = 10 total)\n    4 Campaign Cards(8.5\" x 11\") (3 Double-sided, 1 Single) = 7 Campaigns Total  \n    3 Target Display Cards(8.5\" x 11\") (3 double-sided = 6 displays total)\n\n\nDesigned by Dan Verssen\nDeveloped by Mike Lemick\n\n",

Score one point per trick you take plus a bonus if you make your bid exactly.\n\nFor an additional bonus, you may offer to declare by turning your bidcards face up at start of play, thus declaring your target and revealing more information about the lie of cards.\n\nFor a higher bonus, you may also offer to reveal. This involves not only turning your bid-cards up but also then playing with your hand of cards exposed on the table before the opening lead.\n\nWhile designed for three players, the four-player version is faithful to the original but played with a standard 52-card deck. Two- and five-player variants also exists, but they employ a dummy hand and a 500 deck, respectively.\n\n",

Each turn is fifteen seconds and each square is 10 feet across.\n\nFrom the rulebook: \"The game is designed to recreate, as close as possible, the 'feel' and 'flavor' of infantry combat and the problems and decisions faced by the small unit leader . . . The combat units involved represent the average organizations of the U.S., Germany, and the U.S.S.R. The playing area represents typical European buildings and streets. All names on the maps are in German, but represent typical small town architecture and street plans left over from the Middle Ages . . . Proceed with caution: the town is unfriendly, the enemy is experienced and your men aren't expendable. You have your mission and your organization. As soon as you read the rules and set-up, it will be H-HOUR.\"\n\nFrom designer's William A. Comito's comments in the rulebook: \"A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.\"\n\n",

Players trade in seven commodities: two grains (corn and wheat), two meats (cattle and hogs), one industrial metal (copper), one money instrument (T-Bills), and one precious metal (gold). These commodities differ in their volatility; the higher the volatility, the greater the opportunity for both profit and loss...\nLIMIT UP makes you part of the commodity world. You can speculate on the expected price movement, protect your crop, balance your portfolio and limit your risk, or use high leverage. You compete with government policy, weather, and other market forces.\nNo commodity trade would be complete without an \"inside track\"; someone always seems to know more than others. In LIMIT UP, you know who is the \"insider\", and you can watch that trader adjust his or her portfolio to profit from the news.\n\n",

It is not intended to have any special reference to the present Administration in Washington whose concern for the truth is well known. Ideally the players should regard the game as set in some distant future time.\"\n\nWith this \"Tranquilizing Myth\", 2-4 players are invited to partake in Credibility Gap, a political satire game published during the time when the term \"credibility gap\" was in greatest vogue. It remains equally timely today.\n\nPlayers ferret out the Truths of the Administration from the Big Wheel, recognizing Brittle Analogies, Solemn Platitudes, and other variants while avoiding the dreaded Snow Job. They are aided by cards which, in proper combination, will permit them to give opponents Good or Bad advice, make Demands, gain access by phone or mail to the Big Wheel, or seek for the Big Wheel's Truth Vault itself to attain the elusive Truths. The first player to accumulate 20 Truth markers is the winner.\n\nComponents include:\n\n     4 wooden Liberty Bell movers,\n     80+ wooden Truth markers,\n     a four piece puzzle board,\n     36 \"Administrative Pack\" cards, and\n     58 \"Citizens' Deck\" cards.\n\n\n",

The nations of Europe have many long-standing territorial disputes and historic animosities that only now can erupt into violence. For years, Romania and Hungary could put aside their differences in the face of a greater threat from NATO.

You must be vigilant and find your allies before your enemies can unite against them or you.\n\nPlayers control coloured pawns that represent characters from early in the Buffy TV series, both good (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia) and evil (The Master, Drusilla, and Spike). The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight. The losing side has to drop a character involved in the combat (and the associated player, if any) from the game. Play continues until it's established that all remaining players are on the same side.\n\nSame theme and nearly identical name, but a different game from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game.\n\n",

It has a Igo-Yougo sequence of play with fire combat taking place before or after movement, at owning player's choice (but the non-phasing player always fires first), and melee combat at the end of a player turn.  The command system uses a set of orders changed at the start of player turn, indicated by placing chits next to units or groups of units: MANEUVER (the default), MARCH, INF FIRE, INF ASSAULT, CAV CHARGE, ARTILLERY IN BATTERY, RESERVE.  Units that are out of command range can only switch to Maneuver orders or stay in reserve. Orders affect melee and fire strength and also the strength of a unit's Zone of Control. Victory is terrain and morale-driven. Morale is affected by losses and taking units out of Reserve.\n\nscale = 402 m (0,25mi = 439 yards)/hex; \ntime = 30 min/GT; \nsize = regiment/brigade\n\nCounters = 200\n\n",

The Sagas of Conquest (First edition 2001) was chosen Italian Game of the Year 2001 in LuccaGames, the most distinguished Games Fair in Italy. In the same year was chosen best Independent Production 2001 in Acquicomics Fair.\nNote: Tempus Draconis is the Multilingual edition of Millenarocca (Italian boardgame 2003); But this version have some better changes in the material, pieces and components. Rules in 5 Languages: Italian, French, English, German and Spanish!\n\nThe game develops in 4 phases:\n\n* To set the eight prisoners free\n    * To complete your own Amulet\n    * To defeat the Monster\n    * To come out of the Millenarocca\n\n1 - The Adventurers must set all the Prisoners free, and each Prisoner will give them a piece of Amulet. The first Amulet on top of the pack of cards must be given, you cannot choose. The prisoner freed last will reveal to which element the Monster belongs and this time he will give a piece of Amulet with a sign contrary to that of the Monster, no longer a piece chosen at random.\n\n2 - After freeing the last prisoner, add the remaining pieces of Amulet to the \"Room\" pack of cards, so that every player can complete his/her Amulet. You can attack the Monster only if you have 4 pieces of Amulet and after all the Prisoners have been set free. Re-shuffle the pack of \"Room\" cards and also the pack of the \"Runes of Power\".\n\n3 - Chase the Monster and, if you are able to get it, give it a sound beating! The life points of the Monster are given according to the Monsters Table. It is not at all certain that you will be able to defeat it at the first attack. N.B. The Adventurer that defeats the Monster is teleported out of the Millenarocca, he is safe and he leaves the other players busy with phase 4 of the game.\n\n4 - The Adventurers left must reach one of the exits and they must avoid perishing in the collapse of the Millenarocca.\n\nEssentially, the winners are those able to come out of the Millenarocca.\n\n",

The location of each hit is then determined by another ordered-pair dice roll.  A hit on a location knocks it out unless the location has armor superior to the shell which hit it, and most destroyers have no armor.

The conflict raged for seven weeks in late 1942. Elements of fourteen German divisions of the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army engaged dozens of divisions and brigades of the Soviet 62nd Army in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.\n\nBattle for Stalingrad uses a game-system of German action and Soviet reaction, highlighting the differences in command and tactics employed by the Germans and Soviets at the time. The Ger-mans enjoyed superior application of their air power and artillery. Their efficient communications and command structure, under General Friedrich von Paulus, allowed them to maintain complete initiative in the battle until they were well into the built-up areas of Stalingrad itself. The Soviets, on the other hand, had poor communications among their forces. Lieutenant-General Vasili Chuikov was hard pressed to maintain com-mand of his army, even in the most critical areas of the city. The campaign was finally decided among the burnt out blocks of the dying metropolis, where the Soviets proved themselves masters of urban combat and the German drive to the East was halted.\n\n1980 SPI Version Components;\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 week\nHex: 656 yards / 600 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34\" full color map\nTwo dual-side printed countersheet (One sheet with 400 1/2\" counters and one sheet with 200 1/2\" counters))\nOne 32-page rulebook\nOne 22.25 x 29\" Player Aid Sheet (Setup & Reinforcements)\nTwo 6 sided Dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium-High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n2011 Excalibre Version;\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 week\nHex: 656 yards / 600 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34\" full color map\nThree dual-side printed countersheet (two sheets with 280 1/2\" counters and one sheet with 40 1/2\" counters))\nOne 54-page rulebook\nOne 32-page rules supplement & game analysis booklet\nOne 17 x 20\" Deployment Display Chart\nOne 14 x 22\" Reinforcement Display Chart\nTwo 6 sided Dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium-High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n",

The value of each card is determined by the lowest number showing through one of its holes; the highest-valued wins.  Ties use the next lowest number, etc.  This is the 'quick play' game.\n\nThe more complex game involves each player selecting five different cards (the two players could each use the same card, but no player may play with duplicates).  Players select cards secretly and compare them as in the quick play game.  The losing card is withdrawn (to be replaced by a new card in the next round) and the winner scores the value difference.  Quick plays continue until one player runs out of card or concedes and the winner is determined according to accumulated score.\n\nAdditional rules exist for using the cards as a convention-wide game in which players attempt to accumulate cards originally belonging to as many players as possible through trading and quick play victories.  (See the web site if you want to run this at a convention.)\n\nThe initial set of 20 Punch Cards uses artwork from Dave Dorman's Wasted Lands series.\n\n",

The advanced game requires an initial planning that only a good knowledge of the basic game will allow.\n\nThe unit scale for the game is Battalion level for infantry, and Company level for other units. One hexagon on the map represents a distance of 300 to 500 meters depending on the scenario. Each game turn represents about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nAn innovative system of activation determines the movement sequence for the various units, with the possibility for the \"Command Units\" to perform various additional actions such as calling in artillery support and Rally units.\n\nAll units have the possibility of performing opportunity fire when an enemy unit moves within 2 hexagons of its ZOC.\n\nThe game uses special 6-sided dice for combat with icons instead of numbers to determine outcome according to of the type of target (personnel or armored].\n\nA deck of event cards for both the players, that also provide unit reinforcements, will make each game unique with endless replay ability.\n\nPlayer aid charts for each nationality represent all the essential elements for intuitive play and immediate accessibility. War to Axis will satisfy the beginner and experienced player alike,\nimmersing you in a historically accurate period where you determine the final outcome.\n\nGAME CONTENTS:\n6 geomorphic maps (35x48,5cm each) \n160 unit counters (25x27mm) \n150 plastic chips \n120 plastic stands \n3 army charts \n2 event cards sheets and 32 event cards\n10 special dice (5 black, 4 white, 1 yellow) \n2 pre-cut dice labels sheets \n1 pre-cut hexagons group sheet \n350 counters \n1 English quick start folder \n1 English standard rules \n6 Scenarios\n\n",

With tongue firmly planted in cheek, I have designed a game that simulates all the fun and craziness of a live wargame auction. Based on MODERN ART, the game adds event cards that may be played on yourself or on an opponent during the course of an auction (and includes such cards as \"buying frenzy\" where your emotions take over and you want to buy anything that has cardboard and dice, or the ever popular \"Paranoid\" where a player has come to the conclusion that a person is bidding against him not for the game but to out bid him--it has become personal). The game also adds condition cards that are played after a round of auctions is completed. It simulates that moment when you finally open the box that you've just purchased. With condition cards, you can find anything from a designer's autograph to mildew. The game also comes with a complete description of the companies and games that are up for sale. You will run into companies like EGO Games, \"considered by many including themselves to produce the ultimate wargames, this company features some of the most famous personalities in the hobby. Renowned for their use (some would say abuse) of color, their games feature everything a wargame should have and a lot that isn't necessary. Their motto is 'If you can't understand our games, we are not surprised.'\"\n\n",

            "description": "(from the rulebook:)\n\nThe game starts in October 1791, when the Legislative Assembly is installed.  It ends in September 1795. The game mechanics are mainly diplomacy and negotiations.  Each player represents a \"Political Current\" (or simply a Current), because at this time, there was no permanent political party, but only shifting groups of politicians.  Each Current acts to strengthen its position and increase its fame.  The game uses also elements under no player's control, but which react to the players' actions.\n\nA game can end in several ways, depending on the current political regime, and depending on each player's victory points.  In the real world, the end was the installation of the Directorate in September 1795.\n\nOne interesting feature of the game is the strict seating arrangement: Players are seated from left to right depending on the political stance of their \"Current\" (Sans-Culottes on the left, Royalists on the right, and everyone else in between).  One cannot leave the room to conduct negotiations, but one can whisper--thus it's easier to secretly negotiate with one's neighbor than with someone on the \"other side of the aisle\".\n\n",

Players draw cards and play them to rows, with hungry fish eating everything in front of it until it meets a like fish. A fish doesn't eat its like, and instead goes to the table as a fat fish. When a player has drawn 3 cards of a kind, it can take a fat fish from the table. When the round ends, players score for the most fish in their catch.\n\nReportedly a good, quick filler, with English and French rules in the box (only in the Abacus Edition, the SimplyFun Edition has only English rules).\n\n",

The series was a spin-off of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.\n\nThe game mixes Roll and Move, hand management and memory mechanics. Each player has two hands of cards from distinct day and night decks but has limited opportunities to look at them. During the game, players manipulate their decks and decks of their opponents using different actions which are triggered either by landing on action squares or by action cards.\n\nThe first player to reach his starting point with three souls in one hand and none in the other wins.\n\n",

The \"Glyph\" pieces feature actual hieroglyphics. All the \"Glyphs\" are covered except for one. The challenge is to match six of the thirteen sets of \"Glyphs\" without uncovering the Pharaoh's Curse. A futuristic visitor from outer space brings you greetings and a free match!\n\nThe familiar rules of this game are simple to learn, but include a surprising twist. Players must move one of the covered \"Glyphs\" before uncovering another, making matches surprisingly hard to find.\n\n",

It's the Stock Market in a time warp!\n\nYou start with 100K ($100,000) and your goal is to be the first to reach $1 million. You do this by playing the Stock Market one card at a time. Each game card takes you back to January 1st of a random year in time, where two companies are pitted against each other in a head - to - head match-up.\n\nThese are real companies, with real ratings and real data from the year listed. You must pick one the companies and follow your investment through the year, stopping each quarter to assess whether you want to sell your stock, or hold to the next quarter. The Fourth quarter marks the end of the year, and the end of your turn.\n\nOn your next turn, travel to a new destination in time by picking another card and playing that year through.\n\nHome Page: http://www.mrbigshot.com\n\n",

            "description": "A unique game, Battle Chips contains 30 wooden chips divided into two armies (orcs versus barbarians).  Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.\n\nOn a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.\n\nCertain faces have different abilities, however:\n\n     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),\n     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat\n     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself\n     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).\n\n\nAfter all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.\n\nWhen one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.\n\nWhile it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.\n\nFor those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.\n\n",

In your turn you must move to an adjacent segment and you can then take the track allowed by the new segment that you are in. Furthermore, next turn, you cannot move back into the segment you were in at the start of your last turn (In other words, you cannot go to and from between the same two segments). However, it is possible to impede an opponent because no two players may be in the same segment. As up to six can play, this board can get pretty crowded. In each segment (except for two special symbols) there are images that relate to the piece of track you receive. This track is laid on the tabletop area, there is no board on which they are to be placed. Therefore, your direction and length of track is only limited by the size of your table!\n\nTrack received must be added to one of your lines immediately. The objective is to build three independent lines that end up with a black tile (a station). When one player has achieved this, the game ends and you score a point for every track tile on your network. The most points, wins (note that this might not be the player that ended the game).\n\n",

It uses a 40-card deck Ace through 2 minus the 8,9 and 10 with the Ace being the high and worth the most (11 points), followed by the 3 (10 points), King (4 points), Knight/Queen (3 points) and Infantry/Jack (2 points). All other cards do not score any points.\nEach player is dealt 3 cards with one turned up as the trump suit. Play does not need to follow suit and the winner of each trick replenishes their hand first. The total points in each game are 120 and whoever has the higher scoring wins a manche of the game.\nPlay with 3-6 players just takes a few minor adjustments to the rules or cards and the versions for 4-6 are played with partnerships.\nUsually this game allows speaking between teammates, but no gestures (or only over-table gestures).\nTwo interesting variants are:\n- \"Briscola scoperta\" in which all the cards are face up and visible by all players.\n- \"chiamata\", played with 5 players (3 vs 2). It has an initial bet on the expected final scoring. Who bets the highest amount calls a card, whose owner becomes (secretly) his partner and play with the caller against the other 3 players. So the players (except the called one) do not know exactly who are the opponents and the partners.\n\n",

Rules for TWGBG offer seven different levels of increasingly detailed game play. Regardless of the level of play, however, the path to victory depends as much on putting the best players on the field as in the result cards one draws.\n\nThe use of result cards and a Special Events chart are reminiscent of the Action Cards and \"Z plays\" chart from a contemporary product, Statis-Pro baseball.\n\nOne additional detail regarding TWGBG should be noted. In this game, the players for each team in a given season are those who were set to appear on opening day for that year; however, the stats for that player come from the previous year. For example, stats on the 1980 Don Stanhouse (LA) card reflect his 1979 (Baltimore) performance. This differs from baseball game systems such as Strat-O-Matic or Statis Pro, where card sets were published only after a season was completed.

Each player's set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number. One player (the \"leader\") turns their counters face down and mixes them up. All other players keep theirs face up and orderly, so they can find the numbers quickly and easily and see what numbers are left. The leader draws a counter and announces the number. All players take a counter of the same number from their set. They may play it to one of 4 columns or one of 4 stacks (foundations). Stacks are started with a 1 and go up sequentially to 13. If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed. Your score is the sum of the numbers on the top of your stacks. Each player in turn takes the role of leader and reads off the numbers. Highest score after an agreed-upon number of rounds wins.\n\n",

It is designed for a two-player game of approximately 20 models aside to take an hour or less for experienced players to play. At the same time it gives you all the tactics and control of alternate activation with detailed control of each model's actions.\n\nGame Mechanics \nAll dice rolls are with a d20, low rolls are better, special rules for rolling 1's and 20's (criticals).\nThe measurements are in cm for greater detail and variety amongst units.\nPlay alternates between players with each activating a single unit at a time (individual or squad) and once all units have gone the turn is over.\nThis is designed for an average 750 pt game to require approx. 20 figures a side.\nEach army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.\nThe majority of units are melee units with advantages stacked in favor of more aggressive play.\nAdditional rules cover malfunctions, spellcraft, special abilities, formations and many other advanced gaming features.\n\nDark Age is introduced in the book Genesis, which covers the forces of the Forsaken, led by St. Mark, and opens the setting of this world with their encounters against the non-human Dragyri. The Story continues in Exodus, with the Forces of St. Mary battling the Skarrd, and Evolution, where the Devotees of St. John encounter the Brood.\n\nThe revised Core Rules and several scenarios are presented by themselves in Essence.\n\nThe current version of the Dark Age miniatures rules is Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules with expanded current force lists in Dark Age: Apocalypse â Forcelists\n\n--from publisher\n\n",

The sneakiest, nastiest, dirtiest game in the world!\n\nIt is a simple card game, played over several rounds, in which players manage the cards in their hands in order to score as many points as possible each round.\n\nSome of the cards have positive values and some of the cards have negative values.  There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.\n\nOn his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.\n\nA set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.\n\nAll banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.\n\nAll the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.  If the player has more than one upside down card they cancel each other out.\n\nOnce the hands have been scored another round begins.\n\nThe first player to reach 100 points is the winner.\n\n",

Bid too low and you'll be left behind, so you're tempted to go high - but it could all go horribly wrong. The only consolation is that everyone else is going through exactly the same thing.\"\n Each round you have to bid according to how many facts you can identify as being correct from a list of ten. If you have the highest bid, you have to identify that many correct facts. If all your chosen facts are genuine, you score a point for each of them. If not, you get no points and the next highest bidder's choices are checked. Once someone has won the points for that round, the players who made lower bids score minus the difference between their bid and the bid of the person who won the points.\n\n",

Bids are hidden and simultaneous, high bid gives his chips to the lowest bidder (in case of a tie, the next highest non-tied player wins). Each card, once obtained, has an assignment / action on it that must be carried out. There are also Taxi cards that make players do certain things and bad cards (Jens-Maul Cards) that are awarded randomly but in typical party game fashion: when a bad card turns up, each player has to run to the anti-gravity machine (set up somewhere else in the house, for example) and press the button. Whoever is randomly selected by the player has being the heaviest (i.e. too fat to float) gets the bad card. Each bad card increases the number of cards in a single color needed to win by one: normally you need three of a kind, so having one bad card ups it to four.\n\n",

Each card has multiple questions on the back about the pictured person.\n\nThe object of the game is to identify the person in the picture and then answer questions about that person. The questions asked are determined by a roll of two 6-sided dice. Rewards and penalties are also determined by the number on the dice roll. For example, if the player roles a 7, they answer Question 7 on the card, and receive 10 points if correct PLUS any bonuses indicated next to Question 7. Every time a player fails to answer a question, the opportunity to do so moves to the next player and the value for the correct answer goes up 5 points.\n\nThe \"Quizmaster\" role is first determined by a roll of the dice. This person queries each player in turn, and notes their score on the scorecard. Once all players have been quizzed, the Quizzmaster role then rotates clockwise.\n\nThe accompanying 94-page booklet contains additional biographical information about each celebrity.\n\n",

Jackpot cards increase the value of the pot and Super Odds cards allow you to roll extra dice once all cards have been played.  Each suit is worth a varied amount of points and once the deck has been exhausted, the player with the most points wins.\n\n",

Better improvements can not be hoped for: more money and more consumption, yet more renunciation. Improvements today which are more friendly to life will produce more cultural riches, and more exchanges between all. This is all with a minimal burden on the environment and a maximum amount of self-determination. Put an end to the monopoly!\n\nYou choose a new homeland, a new Bolo. Every Bolo has a special way of life and is nearby. The organization of your chosen community needs you to bring it goods. You obtain distinct items during the course of the game. Any surplus produced in your own Bolo is trade able with other players. Every exchange offers a new experience. Also, every visit to another Bolo brings new knowledge.\n\nWhich Bolo should be judged to be first? Last can quickly become first, as when someone has attained a new innovation, it can quickly be shared with the rest of the collective through visits and the cultural exchanges that result!\n\n---\n\nbolo' bolo is game designer / Anarchist P.M.'s second foray into political board games, with his first being the cult tile laying favourite Demono. bolo' bolo is based upon the book of the same name which lays out P.M.'s ideal society based upon sub-communities, each autonomous, with an economy fueled by trade.\n\nGame components are in both German and French, and are rather archaic with the 'cards' being coloured paper with black ink style drawings, absolutely nothing like Demono's more lush visuals.\n\nThe basic idea of the title is that each player represents one of the \"bolos\" on the board, each of which specialises in the production of certain things, and which needs certain others, which is accomplished via trade.\n\n",

The game begins as a rhythmic word game. Players tap the table and clap in rhythm. The first player calls out a word and the player to his/her left shouts out a word that begins with the final letter of the first word (e.g., word 1 = \"cat\", word 2 = \"ten\", word 3 = \"naked\"...). Players who cannot think of a word, break the rhythm, or who make a mistake must roll a pewter die (it is in the form of a drunk; it reminds me of the pigs in \"Pass the Pigs\") to determine a penalty.\n\nThe position of the die determines the penalty:\n? A choker: take a large swallow.\n? A sticky ear (bottle up): you and the player to your left take a large swallow.\n? A sticky ear (fish up): you and the player to your right take a large swallow.\n? A gutter: choose one of the other players to take a large swallow.\n? A dribbler: propose a toast; everyone takes a drink.\n? A tumble: Off the table, finish your glass.\n\nThe game includes:\n? 1 Pewter drunk figure\n? 1 pen\n? 1 forfeit pad\n? 1 forfeit summary card\n? 1 carry pouch\n? 1 set of rules\n\n",

            "description": "4x4 (aka Vier mal Vier) is an abstract 4-in-a-row variant in which 2 players use 16 grooved cubes to erect a wall between them, aiming to be the first one to create a sequence of 4 identical shapes in their own side of a wall, or of all 4 different ones. This row can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The cubical building bricks are all unique, come in 4 colours, and the only placement restriction is that each colour is only allowed once in each level or column. When the last brick is added, the completed wall will be 4x4.\n\nOn 2 opposing faces of each cube, a groove has been carved out. There are 4 distinct grooves, and the twist is that these grooves rarely mirror each other on either side of a cube. Therefor the wall face will look completely different to each player. The grooves are paired in such a way that within each group of 4 identically coloured cubes, only one cube has an identical shape on both sides (a different one for each colour). The other combinations are unique for that colour, and each combo occurs only one other time within the entire set.\n\nAt the start of the game, the cubes are placed on coloured supply strips which show the 4 'footprints' of all the blocks that exist for each colour. The wall is build on the table surface between the players. Players can only see the top cube of each column and the shape of the groove on their side of the wall of the cubes below it. Forward planning, memory skills and deduction all come into play to some extent, as players above all need to prevent that the opponent gets the sequence of 4 first. The supply strips serve as gentle reminders of what is out there.\n\nThe pro-version introduces the rule that an opponent can force a player to take back the last played cube if it would prevent the wall from completion, and instead insist on the placement of a cube that would result in a wall with the maximum amount of bricks. It also suggest the removal of the reminder strips.\n\n",

Three games may be played...\n\nThe Winning Team: Four cards are dealt to each player and face-up on the table. On your turn, if you can match a card from your hand to a card on the table, you take both cards and place them face-up in a pile in front of you. If you can match a card to the top card on an opponent's pile, you may take the player's entire pile of cards. When no more plays can be made, the player with the most cards wins.\n\nSport Snap: The deck is dealt out evenly among the players. All players simultaneously turn over their top card. If no cards match, turn over another card. If two or more cards match, the first player to call out a correct matching sport wins all stacks with that card on top. If you make a wrong call, you must give 1 card to each opponent. The player that wins all the cards wins the game.\n\nSpoons: Spoons are placed in the center of the table (one less than the number of players). Each player gets 4 cards. The dealer draws a card and either keeps it or passes it to the next player who also can either keep it or pass it etc. As soon as you have a complete set of 4 cards, take a spoon.

Players can trade and haggle with power plants, victory points or leftover energy, but beware of the environmental assessment.\nThe game was designed for a German government agency to raise awareness of renewable energy planning on a communal level.\n\n",

Players must balance the utilization of their shares and gold while planning carefully how they will use their hunters' abilities and their items to create opportunities and combos. However, the main challenge of Hunting Party is the use of Multiple Build Paths. Players are repeatedly asked,\n\nHow do you want to play?\n\nDo you want to build a large party, a cheap party, a party of champions, a diversified party, or a specific one?\n\nDo you want to focus on ability combinations, killing Dark Agents, or attacking other players?\n\nDo you want to hoard gold, hoard items, or solve the Prophecy?\n\nIt's all in how you want to play!\n\nEach game, you'll start off with a different Hero, a variable game board, and a different prophecy to solve, ensuring that you'll never play the same game twice.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     VASSAL (real-time or PBEM)\n\n\n",

The English-language subtitle is \"The Game of the Castle in the Sky Laputa\". The game in all the pictures here on BGG has the Japanese title ããã£ãã£ã¹åå¡ã, meaning \"Fort Tidisu\". (There is another official \"Castle in the Sky\" board game, titled ãå¤©ç©ºã®åã©ãã¥ã¿ã like the film itself. Perhaps the entry you're reading was originally named after that game, not the one in the pictures here, but BGG will not allow the other game to be added to the database without details on its rules.)\n\nThis game has three scenarios:\n\n1. Dola's Surveillance Game (Dola gang vs. the Military): The Dola family of air pirates attempts to penetrate the military surveillance net around the airship transporting Muska and Sheeta.\n\n2. Dola's Airship Attack Game (Dola gang vs. the Military): The Dola family attacks the airship itself, as in the opening scene of the film.\n\n3. Pazu's Sheeta Recapture Game (Solo game): Pazu and the pirates try to break Sheeta out of Fort Tidisu, where Muska has imprisoned her. Player plays as Pazu and the pirate gang, and there's a deck of cards that randomly determines the Goliath's actions and the robot's actions.\n\n",

The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.\n\nThe game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.\n\nAs quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.\n\nThe game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.\n\nPlayers put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.\n\nIt is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available. But after a while, you can get into the flow and the game moves very quickly.\n\n",

The route taken by the Union Pacific just grazed the tip of Colorado at Julesberg and headed west through Wyoming.  Colorado, however, wanted railroads and soon got them.\n\nIn the Colorado Railroads Game, players assume the roles of the big financiers who put together the rails that roamed the Rockies.  Somewhat in the tradition of Heartland Trefoil's 1829, and Avalon Hill's 1830, players buy shares of stock in various railroads, take control of them, and build track from city to city, and city to mine.  The railroads earn money by operating trains between stations.  Player money is earned through dividends to stockholders.  Unlike the above mentioned games, the rails are drawn right on the map, and owned by the railroads who built them (As in Mayfair's Empire Builder system.)  The economic conditions change varying from boom times to depression, and mines appear and disappear at random throughout the game.\n\n",

Chili, Briegel and Bernd are packing to go on holiday and each player is helping them to pack 15 items in their suitcases.\n\nEach player receives a chip with the face of each of the 3 characters, and a number of tiles shaped like cards, planes and ships (modes of holiday transport) in 3 different colours (red, blue, yellow) are placed in the centre. There is a stack of rectangular card tiles showing different numbers of items one might bring on holiday (books, caps, sunglasses, slippers, etc.) and each player reveals one card. Players then place a chip on the items they would like to pack. Cards without chips are discarded, cards with only one chip are taken by the player who put the chip there, leaving cards with more than one chip on them. Ownership of the tiles with more than one chip are resolved by throwing a six-sided die showing the 3 forms of transport and the 3 colours. Players with a chip on the card being competed for now grab as many of the colour or kind of transport shown on the die - the player who grabs the most gets to keep the cards and the items on it.\nThe winner is the first player to pack 15 items in each of his or her 3 character's suitcases.\n\n",

The game comes with several chunky wooden fish in three different colors, with three of each color of fish, each having a different design on them consisting of either squares, circles, or triangles.\n\nOn each turn, someone rolls the two special dice. One die has colored faces, and the other die has shapes. Players look at the die roll and quickly grab the matching fish from the table! For example, if blue and square is rolled, you would want to grab the blue fish with squares on it.\n\nHowever, if a player already has the matching fish in his play area, the players yell \"Splash Attack!\" and grab the red piranha. If the player that already had the matching fish is the first to do this, he gets to permanently keep the fish as a point. If a different player is quickest, however, the player loses the fish back to the center of the table. Thus, you must be the quickest to react to a matching pattern twice in a row to score. The first player to score three fish wins!\n\n",
