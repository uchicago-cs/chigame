The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse (as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. Finally, before the next turn of impulses, spent units are reset and regain the ability to act.\n\nHistorically this began with Storm Over Arnhem (1981) part of the Series: Storm Over area impulse",

A Dutch Auction is sometimes also called a one-bid auction because of this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.\n\nThe purest implementation of this is Merchants of Amsterdam, which features a spring-load mechanism that gradually reduces the price until someone hits it, winning the bid.\n\nThis category also includes the mechanism where items slide down a track, with the cost decreasing as it does so. This is a common implementation of Open Drafting such as in Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization. An alternative but logically equivalent process is Increase Value of Unchosen Resources.",

The winning bidder is the first player, in bid priority, who chooses to pay the current price for a lot, which is equal to the number of bidding tokens there. Priority may be determined by a variety of factors, including global turn order or turn order for each lot based on order of bid placement. Players may typically pass on the purchase when they are the priority bidder by removing their bidding token. This has the effect of reducing the price for the lot by one.\n\nThe Speicherstadt introduced this mechanism. In that, players place meeples one at a time on different lots to be bid on. After all meeples are placed, each lot is evaluated. The player with the first meeple placed on a lot may purchase it, but must pay a price equal to the total number of meeples. If they cannot or will not purchase it, they take their meeple back, and the next meeple in line may purchase, now at $1 less.\n\nThis opens up lots of opportunity for counterplay and brinkmanship in a relatively simple system.",

The highest bidder for each lot wins the lot.\n\nGood examples of this mechanism are in Amun-Re and Vegas Showdown. In these games, there is a track below each lot up for auction. Each player places a marker on the lot they are interested in, at the value they want to pay. If another player wants to bid on that lot they do it by placing their bid marker on a space higher than the current bidder. The outbid player retrieves their bid token, and may place it on the same lot at a higher price, or another lot.\n\nWhen all players have placed their token, the bids are resolved.",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\n\nIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\n\nMicrobadge\n\n Blind bidding fan",

Players then select one (or more) card(s) to keep, and pass the rest to their left. This continues until all cards are selected or discarded. 7 Wonders implements this type of draft.\n\nAn alternative is that only one player is dealt cards, and they take one and pass it until all players have cards. This obviously is strongly biased towards the first player, and needs to be supported thematically and balance-wise. Citadels implements this type of draft.\n\nThis is distinct from Open Drafting, which involves selection from a public display.\n\nMicrobadge\n Card drafting fan",

Initial placement of the item can be either predetermined or random. The delivery of the good usually gives the player money to do more actions with. In most cases, there is a game rule or another mechanic that determines where the item needs to go.\n\nEmpire Builder is a classic pickup-and-deliver game from 1980 that remains popular today. In this game, players build railroads between cities, and move trains around on the track. Players hold contracts specifying that specific cities demand specific types of goods. To fulfill a contract, a player must travel to a city where that good is available, pick it up, and deliver it to the destination city. When the player completes the contract, the player receives money as specified on the contract.\n\nFor an overview and discussion of popular games with this mechanism, see: Pickup-and-Deliver Games: Your favourites and why\n\nMicrobadge\n\n Pick up and deliver games fan",

Push-Your-Luck is also known as press-your-luck.\n\nHere's a description of the category by Bruno Faidutti:\n\nDouble or Quits, Keep going or stop, cash your gains or bet them. The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game &ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini&rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known &ldquo;double or quits&rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson&rsquo;s Can&rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down. It&rsquo;s even trickier when all players are aboard the same ship, not knowing if, or when, it will sink. Time to leave or not ? That&rsquo;s what happen in Aaron Weissblum&rsquo;s Cloud Nine, as well as in Diamant, a game I designed together with Alan R. Moon.\n\nHere's the introduction of the Jeopardy dice games from Reiner Knizia's Dice Games Properly Explained:\n\nYou focus on progessing and maximising your results. But the stakes are rising. If things go wrong, you lose it all. Great risks bring great rewards - or utter defeat!\nDisaster strikes in many different ways. More than ever, you need to weigh up the potential gains and losses. Rolling specific numbers or reaching certain totals may catch you out. You see disaster looming - but can you escape? Other games allow you to continue throwing as long as you keep your options open. Know when to stop and secure your results. If you get greedy and your luck fails, you are out. You need to make the right decisions and be lucky, too.\n\nMicrobadge:  - Fan of Press-Your-Luck Games",

Some games achieve the same effect in reverse: the turn begins with action spaces filled by markers, which are claimed by players for some cost. Each player usually has a limited number of tokens with which to participate in the process, although these may increase as the game progresses.\n\nThere is usually(*) a limit on the number of times a single action may be taken. Once that limit for an action is reached, it typically either becomes more expensive to take again or can no longer be taken for the remainder of the round. As such, not all actions can be taken by all players in a given round, and &quot;action blocking&quot; occurs. If the game is structured in rounds, then all actions are usually refreshed at the start or end of each round so that they become available again.\n\nFrom a thematic standpoint, the game pieces which players use to draft actions often represent &quot;workers&quot; of a given trade (this category of mechanism, however, is not necessarily limited to or by this thematic representation). In other words, players often thematically &quot;place workers&quot; to show which actions have been drafted by individual players. For example, in Agricola each player starts with two pieces representing family members that can be placed on action spaces to collect resources or take other actions like building fences. When someone places a piece on a given space, that action is no longer available until the next round.\n\nKeydom, which was published in 1998, is widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games. Other early design experiments with the mechanism include Bus (1999) and Way Out West (2000). Well known examples of worker placement include Agricola (2007), Caylus (2005) and Stone Age (2008).\n\n(*) The use of the word &quot;usually&quot; in this context is a somewhat controversial point of discussion. For purposes of BGG classification, &quot;action blocking&quot; is a defining element of worker placement. In that case, there must always be a limit on the number of times a single action may be drafted each round.\n\nMicrobadges\n\n Worker Placement fan\n Worker Placement fan",
