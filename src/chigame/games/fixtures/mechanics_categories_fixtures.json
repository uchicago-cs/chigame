The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse (as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. Finally, before the next turn of impulses, spent units are reset and regain the ability to act.\n\nHistorically this began with Storm Over Arnhem (1981) part of the Series: Storm Over area impulse",

A Dutch Auction is sometimes also called a one-bid auction because of this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.\n\nThe purest implementation of this is Merchants of Amsterdam, which features a spring-load mechanism that gradually reduces the price until someone hits it, winning the bid.\n\nThis category also includes the mechanism where items slide down a track, with the cost decreasing as it does so. This is a common implementation of Open Drafting such as in Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization. An alternative but logically equivalent process is Increase Value of Unchosen Resources.",

The winning bidder is the first player, in bid priority, who chooses to pay the current price for a lot, which is equal to the number of bidding tokens there. Priority may be determined by a variety of factors, including global turn order or turn order for each lot based on order of bid placement. Players may typically pass on the purchase when they are the priority bidder by removing their bidding token. This has the effect of reducing the price for the lot by one.\n\nThe Speicherstadt introduced this mechanism. In that, players place meeples one at a time on different lots to be bid on. After all meeples are placed, each lot is evaluated. The player with the first meeple placed on a lot may purchase it, but must pay a price equal to the total number of meeples. If they cannot or will not purchase it, they take their meeple back, and the next meeple in line may purchase, now at $1 less.\n\nThis opens up lots of opportunity for counterplay and brinkmanship in a relatively simple system.",

The highest bidder for each lot wins the lot.\n\nGood examples of this mechanism are in Amun-Re and Vegas Showdown. In these games, there is a track below each lot up for auction. Each player places a marker on the lot they are interested in, at the value they want to pay. If another player wants to bid on that lot they do it by placing their bid marker on a space higher than the current bidder. The outbid player retrieves their bid token, and may place it on the same lot at a higher price, or another lot.\n\nWhen all players have placed their token, the bids are resolved.",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\n\nIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\n\nMicrobadge\n\n Blind bidding fan",

In this game, the first player makes the first move of the game, and then the second player can choose to switch sides (taking over the first player's color as well as that first move), or to let the first player stay with that color and first move, and the second player then makes their first move in response to the first player's move.

In most cases, there is a game rule or another mechanic that determines where the item needs to go.\n\nEmpire Builder is a classic pickup-and-deliver game from 1980 that remains popular today. In this game, players build railroads between cities, and move trains around on the track. Players hold contracts specifying that specific cities demand specific types of goods. To fulfill a contract, a player must travel to a city where that good is available, pick it up, and deliver it to the destination city. When the player completes the contract, the player receives money as specified on the contract.\n\nFor an overview and discussion of popular games with this mechanism, see: Pickup-and-Deliver Games: Your favourites and why\n\nMicrobadge\n\n Pick up and deliver games fan",

Push-Your-Luck is also known as press-your-luck.\n\nHere's a description of the category by Bruno Faidutti:\n\nDouble or Quits, Keep going or stop, cash your gains or bet them. The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game &ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini&rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known &ldquo;double or quits&rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson&rsquo;s Can&rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down. It&rsquo;s even trickier when all players are aboard the same ship, not knowing if, or when, it will sink. Time to leave or not ? That&rsquo;s what happen in Aaron Weissblum&rsquo;s Cloud Nine, as well as in Diamant, a game I designed together with Alan R. Moon.\n\nHere's the introduction of the Jeopardy dice games from Reiner Knizia's Dice Games Properly Explained:\n\nYou focus on progessing and maximising your results. But the stakes are rising. If things go wrong, you lose it all. Great risks bring great rewards - or utter defeat!\nDisaster strikes in many different ways. More than ever, you need to weigh up the potential gains and losses. Rolling specific numbers or reaching certain totals may catch you out. You see disaster looming - but can you escape? Other games allow you to continue throwing as long as you keep your options open. Know when to stop and secure your results. If you get greedy and your luck fails, you are out. You need to make the right decisions and be lucky, too.\n\nMicrobadge:  - Fan of Press-Your-Luck Games",

            "description": "A stylized form of Action Drafting, players place tokens (typically the classic person-shaped &quot;meeple&quot;) to trigger an action from a set of actions available to all players, generally one-at-a-time and in turn order. Some games achieve the same effect in reverse: the turn begins with action spaces filled by markers, which are claimed by players for some cost. Each player usually has a limited number of tokens with which to participate in the process, although these may increase as the game progresses.\n\nThere is usually(*) a limit on the number of times a single action may be taken. Once that limit for an action is reached, it typically either becomes more expensive to take again or can no longer be taken for the remainder of the round. As such, not all actions can be taken by all players in a given round, and &quot;action blocking&quot; occurs. If the game is structured in rounds, then all actions are usually refreshed at the start or end of each round so that they become available again.\n\nFrom a thematic standpoint, the game pieces which players use to draft actions often represent &quot;workers&quot; of a given trade (this category of mechanism, however, is not necessarily limited to or by this thematic representation). In other words, players often thematically &quot;place workers&quot; to show which actions have been drafted by individual players. For example, in Agricola each player starts with two pieces representing family members that can be placed on action spaces to collect resources or take other actions like building fences. When someone places a piece on a given space, that action is no longer available until the next round.\n\nKeydom, which was published in 1998, is widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games. Other early design experiments with the mechanism include Bus (1999) and Way Out West (2000). Well known examples of worker placement include Agricola (2007), Caylus (2005) and Stone Age (2008).\n\n(*) The use of the word &quot;usually&quot; in this context is a somewhat controversial point of discussion. For purposes of BGG classification, &quot;action blocking&quot; is a defining element of worker placement. In that case, there must always be a limit on the number of times a single action may be drafted each round.\n\nMicrobadges\n\n Worker Placement fan\n Worker Placement fan",

Elimination games like Clue expect players to arrive at the right conclusion after narrowing down possibilities from a large list. Signalling games like Werewolf allow for a set of observations and player-driven feedback (which may not be truthful) to arrive at the right conclusion out of 2-3 main choices. Finally, this Category includes Induction games like Zendo, in which players must derive a general rule out of near infinite possibilities.\n\nSocial deduction games are a related sub-category that is proving increasingly popular, and includes games with hidden roles and bluffing such as The Resistance and One Night Werewolf.

            "description": "Wargames are games that depict military actions. Wargames are set in a variety of timelines, from the Ancient period to present conflicts and even in the future.  Thematically, Wargames cover everything from actions between small units on a very small board to larger, extremely detailed conflicts and even global-scale wars.  Although most Wargames are based on historical situations, there are Wargames based on fantasy or science fiction, as well as Wargames based on hypothetical but historically-based situations (e.g., nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the USA). Probably the most popular period for Wargames is World War II, followed by the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War. However, Wargames cover a vast range of conflicts, and if you are interested in a particular war you are quite likely to be able to find a game that covers it in some way.\n\nThree levels\n\nA Wargame will be at one of three levels of warfare - tactical, operational, or strategic. Tactical games depict a skirmish, battle or series of battles, using smaller scale units and maps that depict a battleground that is a few miles or less - sometimes much less - in size. Examples of tactical wargames include Advanced Squad Leader and Combat Commander: Pacific.\n\nOperational wargames cover a broader scope of military actions, greater than single battles. These may cover an entire smaller war, or a series of operations or a campaign within a greater war. Units are larger than in tactical games. Examples of operational level Wargames include Fortress Europa and 1914: Twilight in the East.\n\nWargames on the strategic level usually recreate a major war on a large scale. Typically units in such a game will be corps or army level, although in so-called &quot;monster&quot; Wargames (no set definition, but usually a game with large maps and lots of counters that takes a long time to play) divisions and even smaller sized units can be depicted. Strategic Wargames are more likely than tactical or operational level games to include big-picture issues such as production of new military units. Examples of strategic-level Wargames include World in Flames, Paths of Glory, and Here I Stand.\n\nOther aspects\n\nBeyond the level of Wargames are other choices - for example, games that focus exclusively on naval battles and campaigns are common. Examples include Wooden Ships & Iron Men and Sixth Fleet: Modern Naval Combat in the Mediterranean. Similarly, Wargames depicting air battles are popular.\n\nWithin these rough definitions are a huge variety of mechanics, themes, and approaches, and many levels of complexity; it is generally accepted that on average, Wargames are more complex than other types of games, although this is not a hard and fast rule. Naturally, all Wargames include combat - although not all games that include combat would typically be deemed Wargames; for example, Imperial and Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery have combat and military forces, but most wargamers would not see them as Wargames. Some Wargames include political considerations, for example Ici, c'est la France! The Algerian War of Independence 1954 - 1962or Triumph of Chaos.\n\nNumber of players\n  \nMost Wargames are designed for two players, particularly tactical games. However, a significant minority are designed to be playable by three or more. Examples of Wargames for more than three players include World in Flames, Friedrich, Here I Stand, and Pax Romana.  Victory conditions in Wargames vary greatly, as does the subject matter. Common paths to victory include capturing one or more objectives on the map; destruction of a certain portion of an enemy force; accumulating victory points gained by a variety of means including taking objectives and destroying enemy units.\n\nCardboard and Miniatures\n\nMost Wargames use cardboard counters to depict military units, with symbols and numbers on the counters that describe each unit's attributes. Common attributes include the unit's size, type (e.g., cavalry, cruiser, archer, mechanized infantry...) combat strength, and speed of movement - but many other attributes such as morale, status of the unit, nationality, etc. can also be found. Wargames that use miniature figures to depict military units are also quite popular as are wargames with wooden blocks for units, called Block Games.\n Finally, there are many different approaches to Wargame mechanics. For movement, mechanics include hex-based movement (example: The Russian Campaign), area movement (Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453), or point-to-point movement (Friedrich); note that is is rare for movement to rely on the roll of dice. Combat is often resolved by rolling dice and referring to a Combat Resolution Table (CRT) (for example, Rise and Decline of the Third Reich or Lee vs. Grant: The Wilderness Campaign of 1864), or by rolling dice to 'hit' opposing units (e.g.,Wellington: The Peninsular War 1812-1814), or by computing odds and drawing a card to see the result (Kingmaker). A popular mechanic over the past 15 or so years is the card-driven game (CDG), where cards are played either to activate units for movement or for the benefits described on the card such as reinforcements; We the People is seen as the first such CDG, and other examples include Paths of Glory and Empire of the Sun.\n\nLinks: History of Wargame\n\n\nOn BGG\n\nLinks\n\nWargames on BGG are ranked: rank list.\nSee also the Wargamer's Guide to Wargaming Geeklists, a repository of geeklists holding special interest for wargamers.\n\nAll Wargames magazines are listed and detailed at Game magazines page.\n\nHistorical categories on BGG:\n\n\n    Ancient\n    Medieval\n    Renaissance\n    Pike and Shot\n    Age of Reason\n    Napoleonic\n    Post-Napoleonic\n    World War I\n    World War II\n    Korean War\n    Vietnam War\n    Modern Warfare\n\n\nNorth America:\n\n    American Revolutionary War\n    American Civil War\n    American Indian Wars\n    American West",
